DevCanvas ([devcanvas.art](https://devcanvas.art)) began as a fun experiment born from my journey learning SvelteKit and Supabase. What started as a simple platform for storing code snippets quickly evolved into something much more cooler: _an online editor that makes it easy to prototype and share ideas quickly and effortlessly._

### The Evolution

A platform for storing code snippets, an idea I conceived while helping someone debug their code. The platform used to be called snippetland, but after getting deep in building and also trying to establish the name and stuff, i realized that another service named snippetland that does the same thing (even better) exists.

> Lesson: Don't be foolish to think you've come up with a unique name 😅. as wisely said, "There’s nothing new under the sun".

Snippetland early twitter posts:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Most pages for snippets are coming together greate 💪 , including the editor page 😁!<br><br>Happy Weekends 😪 ! <a href="https://t.co/jv1CsD8Gle">pic.twitter.com/jv1CsD8Gle</a></p>&mdash; Abdulmumin Yaqeen (@abdulmuminyqn) <a href="https://twitter.com/abdulmuminyqn/status/1690427906751651841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2023</a></blockquote> 
The current form, which is a full-fledged online editor with cool features was just an experimentation. I first demoed it on twitter a long time ago.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shipped so so many new features to SnippetLand during the weekend.<br><br>- New Look<br>- Snippets Preview<br>- HTML/CSS Playground embed<br>- User Profiles<br><br>At this point, it not a prototype anymore 🤭. <br>Give it a try 🧡.

Seeing these again, devcanvas has definitely come a really long way.

Storing snippets still exists on DevCanvas, but haven't gotten any updates for a while now.

### Key Features of Devcanvas

- Easy prototyping
- Effortless sharing
- Real-time editing (i.e fast previews)
- Super neat interface (from my perspective at least)

Got myself into a trial and error loop making the preview as fast as possible, most of the problem coming from network resource the might be brought in into the editor. Whoa, I just conceived a superb idea while writing this (would implement later).

### Tech Stack

Devcanvas is built with Sveltekit, TailwindCSS, Supabase and no Typescript (I wish I did though).

Though not the coolest or hardest product to build or make money from, The process of building it was incredibly enjoyable, and using it is just as fun – hence the tagline, "The Editor with Super Powers".

Currently, DevCanvas is completely free to use.

### Open Source

DevCanvas is proudly open source, even though, It has always just been me building this for while. I hope to get others involved in this as will to make DevCanvas even better and cooler.

> Warning: Lots of technical debt and ugly code, but i'm working to make it better for contribution.
