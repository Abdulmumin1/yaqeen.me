Hey fellow builders! üëã

I built an analytics tool Littlestats, and this is the story of why I built yet another analytics tool (I know, I know - but stick with me here).

## The Problem I Faced

Ever launched a side project or small business website? Then you know this feeling:

You're excited about your new project. You want to know if people are actually using it. So you add analytics.

"Cool, they have a free plan!" üòé

Until you realize:

Want to know where your traffic comes from? That's premium.

- Need to track button clicks? Premium feature.
- Want to see which countries visit your site? You guessed it... premium.

Suddenly that "free" plan feels like a demo, and you're staring at a $19-$29/month upgrade just to get basic insights about your website.

Sound familiar?

I looked around for alternatives:

- Google Analytics: Free but privacy concerns and increasingly complex
- Self-hosted solutions: The option i would generally go for, but didn't find the time, managing such on your own also sucks.
- Other SaaS analytics: All seemed to start at range of $19 - $29/month (yeah they do have a higher number of sites/domains, but that way more than my needs)

### The Solution: Littlestats

So I built Littlestats with a simple promise:

**Everything you actually need from analytics, for the price of a coffee (or maybe two coffee now üòÖ).**

### What do MicroSaaS founders actually need?

- Traffic monitoring ‚úÖ
- Conversion tracking ‚úÖ
- Geographic data ‚úÖ
- Source attribution ‚úÖ
- Custom events ‚úÖ

### What don't we need?

- Machine learning predictions
- Complex user journey mapping
- 47 different dashboard views
- Enterprise-grade features we'll never use
- Adding mediocre AI features to justify the price

### Why $7

While most analytics tools charge $9-29/month for just 10k-30k hits per month, we're giving you 50k monthly hits for $7. Simple as that.

We're keeping it simple and affordable for bootstrappers and indie hackers - no complicated tiers, no enterprise bloat, just clean analytics that help you make better decisions.

### The Technical Bits You'll Care About

- <2kb script size (your users won't even notice it)
- No cookies (GDPR-friendly)
- First-party data collection (no third-party trackers)

### Who's This For?

- üéØ Bootstrapped founders running 1-5 microsaas
- üéØ Side-project builders validating ideas
- üéØ Indie hackers watching their burn rate
- üéØ Small agency owners managing multiple client sites

### Who's This Not For?

Let's be real:

- If you need enterprise features, this isn't for you
- If you're doing >50k hits/month, you've outgrown us
- If you need ML-powered predictions, look elsewhere

### The Price Breakdown You Actually Care About

$7/month gets you:

- 5 websites (will increase in the future)
- 50k hits/month
- All features included
- No upsells or hidden fees

### Ready to Stop Overpaying?

2. Add one line of code
3. Stop thinking about analytics and focus on building

No credit card required. If you hate it, just don't subscribe after the trial.

### A Personal Note

I built this because I needed it. If you're running small SaaS products or websites, you probably need it too.
