At some point, I begin to notice the ugly and super orthodox scrollbars of the Chromium-based browsers more than ever. Everyone maybe does, or is it just me?

I guess not!

It breaks our amazing designs so many times, that we sometimes customize it, if it happens to be a side project of ours, otherwise, we just ignore it.

Also, accessibility is another reason to keep it. But it doesn't have to be as ugly ðŸ¤¢.

In this article, We're going to go through scrollbars and their properties that we can edit/customize. I'm also going to Introduce SleekScroll, which is a Chrome extension that gives you the ability to customize your browser scrollbar look.

## Scrollbars

Scrollbars can be styled and customized using CSS properties, although the level of customization varies across different browsers and their versions. Here are some of the properties that can be edited or styled for scrollbars:

1. **Scrollbar Width and Height:**

   - `width` and `height` properties to adjust the size of the scrollbar.

2. **Scrollbar Colors:**

   - `scrollbar-color` or `-webkit-scrollbar-color` to set the color of the scrollbar thumb (not widely supported).

3. **Scrollbar Track and Thumb:**

   - `scrollbar-track-color` or `-webkit-scrollbar-track-color` to set the color of the scrollbar track.
   - `scrollbar-thumb-color` or `-webkit-scrollbar-thumb-color` to set the color of the scrollbar thumb.

4. **Scrollbar Corner:**

   - `scrollbar-corner` or `-webkit-scrollbar-corner` to set the color of the scrollbar corner (where horizontal and vertical bars meet).

5. **Scrollbar Shadow:**

   - `scrollbar-shadow-color` or `-webkit-scrollbar-shadow-color` to set the color of the scrollbar shadow.

6. **Scrollbar Borders:**

   - `scrollbar-width` or `-webkit-scrollbar-width` to set the width of the scrollbar.
   - `scrollbar-border-color` or `-webkit-scrollbar-border-color` to set the color of the scrollbar border.

7. **Scrollbar Behavior:**

   - `scrollbar-autohide` or `-webkit-scrollbar-autohide` to control the auto-hiding behavior of the scrollbar.

8. **Scrollbar Pseudo-elements:**

   - `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element to target the entire scrollbar.
   - `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` pseudo-element to target the scrollbar thumb.
   - `::-webkit-scrollbar-track` pseudo-element to target the scrollbar track.

Here is an example of a customized scrollbar on devCanvas

The accessibility bros are going to yell at you if you try to get rid of it, or even give you a convincing argument that it is perfect. But for me, it is super-duper ugly.

Till that is fixed, here is 'sleek scroll'.
