Pull Request has become a central part of our workflows. They empower us with the ability to discuss and review code changes, bug fixes, features, and others, before merging into the codebase.

From crafting to reviewing pull requests, these are really mentally draining tasks for developers. Most of us at various workplaces feel stuck, awaiting our PRs to be merged or rejected, which always seems to be “in review”. This is no surprise as maintainers are required to understand the scope and changes made to the codebase which is time-consuming and really hard.

Taking advantage of AI, more products have started to emerge to help us with this workflow. Empowering us with features that help us craft better Pull Requests and most importantly, help maintainers understand our Pull Requests better. GitHub's Copilot for Pull Requests is a great example of this, but there is an even better option, Codium.ai [PR-Agent](https://www.codium.ai/products/git-plugin/).

In this article, we’ll compare GitHub’s **_Copilot for Pull Request_** and **_Codium.ai Pull Request Agent_** over Availability, Features, and Customization. We’ll also cover the two main advantages of using **_Codium.ai Pull Request Agent_** over **_Copilot for Pull Request_**, the different uses for both PR agents, and the three key tips to get the most out of **_Codium.ai Pull Request Agent_**.

# Features

In this section, I have put together a set of unique features and also generic features that both of the products possess. And also how these features weigh against one another.

## Generic features

When we refer to "generic features," we're highlighting fundamental functionalities that serve as the backbone of software or tools. These features are often essential, foundational elements that contribute significantly to the overall usability and effectiveness of a product. In the context of Codium’s PR-Agent and Copilot for Pull Request, exploring their generic features unveils the core functionalities that are essential for streamlining the pull request process. These features form the basis upon which more advanced and specialized functionalities are built, playing a crucial role in enhancing user experience and productivity.

**Auto-Description**

This feature allows you to generate descriptions for pull requests, this walks through your codebase tries to understand the changes you’ve made, and generates a short and digestible description for your pull request. Both products do this, but in a different way.

The way Codium’s PR-Agent Implements this is, after creating the pull request, you can then tag the **@CodiumAI-Agent** along with the describe command, and it will reply with the description of the pull request, Copilot on the other hand implements this nicely, with markers you can add to the description of your pull request and it auto-fills with the AI analysis result of the pull request.

Both demo shown below.

I also love the code suggest, which is able to provide a list of actionable suggestions which is indeed very helpful.

**_/improve_** **with extra instructions - Pro feature**

/Improve is a command that allows Codium’s PR-Agent to improve the quality of your pull request, which is already a great feature, but It gets even better with the custom Instructions. Having the ability to customize what and how the AI should Improve on your code in some particular areas or based a theme.

# Availability

The availability of an AI tool across various platforms is pivotal, considering not all developers or companies rely solely on GitHub. In this context, Codium’s PR-Agent holds a significant advantage.

While GitHub’s Copilot for Pull Requests exclusively operates within the GitHub ecosystem, Codium’s PR-Agent offers support across multiple Git providers. Its accessibility extends beyond GitHub, encompassing platforms like Gitlab, Bitbucket, CodeCommit, Azure DevOps, Gerrit, and more.

This broad compatibility places Codium’s PR-Agent in a superior position compared to Copilot for PR, catering to diverse developer environments and ensuring broader accessibility and utility.

# Customization

There is a good amount of customization in Codium’s PR-Agent compared to Copilot for PR, you can change the AI model, Develop additional logic for handling your pull requests and Add additional context to the prompt; which is a feature that is yet to be available.

# Why Choose Copilot For Pull Request?

Contemplating the ideal tool for managing Pull Requests leads us to explore the advantages of choosing Copilot. This innovative solution presents unique offerings that cater to various aspects of the PR workflow, and has a native tool created by GitHub, you can bet it will perform better on the platform. The only downside is that this tool is only limited to GitHub.

Here are two reasons one might consider choosing Copilot for Pull Requests:

# Why Choose Codium’s PR-Agent?

As stated earlier, we are going to go over two main point of choosing Codium’s PR-Agent over Copilot for Pull Request. While Copilot offers a rich array of sophisticated tools, there's a perspective that it might not excel in handling daily, repetitive workflows—specifically, the constant review of PRs. This opinion suggests that while Copilot shines with its advanced functionalities, it might not seamlessly accommodate the repetitive nature of daily PR reviews as effectively as Codium’s PR-Agent does, as we’ve seen in the features above.

Apart from features, Codium’s PR-Agent outperforms Copilot due to two main reasons:

## 1. Open Sourced

Codium’s PR-Agent is an active open source software, that welcomes contribution from the community.

Such an accessible development system has some serious advantages. Open source software is often more secure because the community from around the world scrutinizes new releases and bugs get reported and addressed fast. Also, the community is motivated to add cool new features to open-source platforms which means open-source software is often just as good, if not better, than competing products.

This distinction positions Codium’s PR-Agent favorably against Copilot for Pull Request, making it more appealing to developers, especially considering our love for open source!

## 2. Cross-Platform Accessibility

PR-Agent Availability on multiple git provided is another reason to choose it, This means you have the AI with you no matter what platform you find yourself with.

This adaptability means that developers or organizations operating beyond GitHub can harness the AI capabilities offered by Codium’s PR-Agent, expanding its utility across diverse ecosystems.

**In Conclusion**
